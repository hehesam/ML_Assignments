1. Initialization:
    S = training set S = {(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(xn,yn)}
    x* = query new point
    distnaces = []
2. computing the distance:
    for i in n:
        distances[i] = ||x*-xi|| (Euclidian distance or other metrics)
3. finding the nearest neighbor:
    sorted_inddices = arg_sort(distances)
4. assing the nearest neighbor to x*
    j = sorted_indices[0]
    y* = y[j]
